# VPN/Proxy Simulator Project Proposal

## Overview
This project aims to develop a VPN/Proxy Simulator that demonstrates secure traffic forwarding between clients and servers using TCP and TLS protocols. The system will create a secure tunnel for data transmission, implementing encryption for enhanced security.

## Architecture

### Components
1. **Client Module**
   - Handles user connections and requests
   - Implements TLS client functionality
   - Manages connection to proxy server

2. **Proxy Server**
   - Acts as intermediary between client and target server
   - Implements both TLS server and client capabilities
   - Manages concurrent connections
   - Handles traffic forwarding

3. **Connection Manager**
   - Manages TCP connections
   - Implements connection pooling
   - Handles connection lifecycle

4. **Encryption Layer**
   - Implements TLS protocol
   - Manages certificates and keys
   - Handles secure handshake

### Data Flow
```
Client <-> [TLS] <-> Proxy Server <-> [TLS] <-> Target Website
```

## Technical Specifications

### Core Technologies
- Programming Language: Go (for high-performance networking)
- Network Protocol: TCP
- Security Protocol: TLS 1.3
- Certificate Management: Self-signed certificates for development

### Key Features
1. **TCP Tunneling**
   - Reliable connection handling
   - Efficient data streaming
   - Connection pooling

2. **TLS Security**
   - Secure handshake
   - Certificate validation
   - Encrypted data transmission

3. **Traffic Management**

   - Error handling and recovery

4. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Connection statistics
   - Traffic metrics
   - Error logging
